WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net ram_rd is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <slideswitch<4>_IBUF> is incomplete.
   The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <slideswitch<5>_IBUF> is incomplete.
   The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <slideswitch<6>_IBUF> is incomplete.
   The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <slideswitch<7>_IBUF> is incomplete.
   The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <button<0>_IBUF> is incomplete. The
