# cpus-pdp8
Verilog FPGA PDP-8/i cpu

A working PDP-8/i cpu with an RF08 disk emulator which uses a IDE disk as a backing store.  It boots TSS/8.

Included are several versions of TSS/8 sources with utilites to build the base o/s from scratch.

A base file system with utilties is required as I have not yet found all the sources for the base utilties.
